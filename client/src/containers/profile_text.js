      <strong>I am a software engineer with a passion for collaboration, learning, and solving challenges in creative ways. </strong> 
       As a full stack web developer, I am excited by the opportunitiy to cultivate the spark of an idea into a mature application. Two constants in my
       life have always been an interest in helping others, as well as an affinity for all things computer-related. As a software engineer, I am elated I get to combine the two.

      When I am not in front of the computer, I enjoy exploring redwood forests, cooking elaborate low carb meals, and sitting by a crackling fire with a book.
